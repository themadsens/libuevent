LibUEvent - A Microscopic event library.
========================================

The libuevent library is a small event library in the style of the venerable
Xt(3) event loop.

Basically an event context is created,and handlers for timeounts and stream
events can be registered with this context.

After initial setup, the typical application will enter the event loop that
will only return at program termination.

The C API
---------
The typical application will do the following steps
1. Create the event context with lueCtxtCreate()
2. Register initial callbacks with lueAddInput, lueAddOutput and lueAddTimer
3. Enter the event loop

Lua binding
-----------
A lua binding is available that should mix well with luasocket and luaposix.

Building
--------
Use make:

* make all: The library
* make test: Test and showcase
* make lua: Build the lua binding

Installation
------------
Is purely manual, but would be something along the lines of:
 sudo install -m 444 libuevent.so.1 /usr/lib/libuevent.so.1
 sudo install -m 444 lualue.so /usr/lib/lua/5.1/lue.so
